ui fixed -
- after upload successful no message to declare upload was successful.->the function is there but not working for some reason. dig into reddit,gihubt,yt to fix this bug. alert only appears in laptop view not mobile view.
- report display page has very bad ui.->fixed
- the uploading logic needs to be improved to allow MULTIPLE upload and pdf upload.
- make a separate profile access page so that users can access their own data without any scanning.->fixed

what is the utility of the scanner. if for some reason i cannot log into my account i can still access my records if the scanner is available.


date extraction pla:-
User selects image

Frontend uploads image (temporary)
↓
Backend runs OCR + date extraction
↓
Backend returns:
  - suggestedDate
  - confidenceScore
↓
Frontend:
  - autofills date field
  - highlights it
  - allows edit
↓
User taps “Confirm & Save”
↓
Final submit (file + verified date)

drawback of my pharmcy filtering:-
🚨 Hard truth first (no sugarcoating)
You CANNOT use Google Maps’ “nearest pharmacy” logic without using a Google Maps / Places API.
Why?
Google’s “nearest” is not just distance
It uses:
Road network distance (not straight-line)
Live traffic
Business relevance
Branch clustering
Popularity & activity
All of that logic is proprietary
It is only exposed via paid Google APIs
👉 There is no free endpoint, no URL trick, no embed hack that gives you:
“Give me the nearest branch exactly like Google Maps”
Opening Google Maps via link ≠ accessing Google’s ranking logic.

❌ What is NOT POSSIBLE (important, no false hope)
Goal	Possible?
Get Google/Bing pharmacy suggestions	❌
Use Google Maps ranking internally	❌
Scrape Google/Bing Maps	❌ (illegal + blocked)
Get full business list without API	❌

Even opening Google Maps with lat/lng:

❌ does not give you the list back

❌ does not expose suggestions programmatically

✅ What IS POSSIBLE (best realistic solution)

You need to change your mental model slightly.

🔁 Final correct model

Your app should NOT try to replace Google/Bing discovery
Your app should augment it.
